        <b>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY APPLY TO, AND IN SOME IMPORTANT RESPECTS LIMIT OR PREVENT, YOUR ABILITY TO FILE, PURSUE, AND/OR PARTICIPATE IN LEGAL OR EQUITABLE CLAIMS, AND/OR CLASS ACTIONS AGAINST POS PROS, AND/OR THAT RELATE IN ANY WHATSOEVER TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.</b><br/><br/><br/>
        In the event that any controversy, claim, or dispute arises between the Parties of any kind whatsoever, including but not limited to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the obligations and services to be performed thereunder, including any claims based on contract, tort or otherwise (collectively, “Claims”), the Parties agree to resolve any and all such Claims on an individual basis solely through final and binding arbitration conducted before a single arbitrator (“Arbitrator”), pursuant to the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), which Rules and Procedures may be viewed at www.adr.org, or obtained by calling AAA customer service at (800) 778-7879 (hereinafter referred to as “the” or “an” “Arbitration”). This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). Any disputes between the Parties regarding the arbitrability of this Agreement, including any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement and of this arbitration requirement, shall be governed by the FAA, and shall be resolved exclusively and solely by the Arbitrator. <b>This means that You will not be able to file any Claim(s) in any court, whether state or federal, or before any other tribunal or forum of any type, with the sole exception of an Arbitration.</b><br/><br/><br/>
        The Arbitrator shall be neutral, independent, and shall otherwise comply with the AAA code of ethics. The Arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the applicable AAA rules. The Arbitration hearing shall be conducted in the City and County of Los Angeles, California. The Parties agree that the laws of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, shall govern this Agreement and any Arbitration. Any Arbitration Claim or related court proceeding shall be filed in the City and County of Los Angeles. The Parties and their respective successors and assigns retain the right to seek provisional remedies from a court, pending final determination of the dispute by the Arbitrator.<br/><br/><br/>
        Any Arbitration must be brought within the one-year statute of limitations/repose as explained below. If any part of this Arbitration Clause is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the balance of this Arbitration Clause shall remain in full force and effect, and shall be construed in accordance with its terms, as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. If the entire Arbitration Clause is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the remaining terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, including the waiver of the right to proceed in a class action set forth and explained in Section 4 below. The award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all Parties, with no rights of appeal or review, other than in certain extremely limited instances. Judgment on the award made by the Arbitrator may be entered and/or enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.<br/><br/><br/>
        The Parties agree that the deadline to commence any Arbitration shall be within <b>one (1) year</b> of (1) any claimed breach of contract; (2) or the reasonable discovery of the facts that give rise to or relate to any other Claim. The Parties further agree that if any Claim/Arbitration is commenced <b>after this one-year statute of limitations has passed</b>, it shall be barred in its entirety, and subject to immediate dismissal with prejudice by the Arbitrator. Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Party from raising any and all other defenses, including, without limitation, the equitable doctrine of laches.<br/><br/><br/>
        The Parties further agree that either Party may only bring Claims against the <b>other in his, her or its individual capacity</b>, and not as a named plaintiff or as a class member in any putative class action or similar representative proceeding. <b>Consequently, You expressly agree to irrevocably and fully waive the right to bring or to participate in any class action or consolidated proceeding of any type whatsoever that involves POS PROS and/or the subject matter of this Agreement</b>. The Parties also agree that the Arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings of more than one person\'s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding relating to any Claims.<br/><br/><br/>
        The prevailing Party in any Arbitration shall be entitled to recover from the losing Party its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, as determined by the Arbitrator. In addition, in the event that a Party (1) fails to proceed with Arbitration by instead filing Claims in any other forum or a court, (2) unsuccessfully challenges the Arbitrator\'s award, or (3) fails to comply with the Arbitrator\'s award, the other Party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit, including all reasonable attorneys\' fees, for having to compel arbitration or enforce the Arbitration award. This section and the Arbitration requirement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.<br/><br/><br/>
        <b>THE PARTIES FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BY PROCEEDING IN ARBITRATION AS THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES, THEY ARE KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVING AND GIVING UP (1) THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN FEDERAL OR STATE COURT, (2) THE RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY OR A JUDGE, AND (3) RIGHTS SUCH AS EXPANDED DISCOVERY, APPELLATE RIGHTS, ETC. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO THEM IF THEY HAD FILED THEIR CLAIM IN COURT AGAINST POS PROS.</b><br/><br/>

        <b><i>MERCHANT PAYMENT CARD APPLICATION - TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</i></b>\n\n
        This AGREEMENT is made by and BETWEEN BBVA COMPASS BANK (“BANK”), A National Banking Association, Paysafe Payment Processing Solutions,
        LLC (jointly referred to as “BANK”) and the undersigned, “MERCHANT” and is subject to the approval of BANK. The parties hereto agree as follows:\n\n
        <b>1.0	AGREEMENT:</b>\n\n
        1.1	This document, as well as other documents executed by MERCHANT, pursuant to the acceptance of BANK, shall be incorporated herein and made a part hereof and shall constitute the entire agreement between BANK and MERCHANT.\n\n
        1.2	MERCHANT agrees that throughout the term of this Agreement, it will not use the services of any bank, corporation, entity or any person other than BANK for the processing of payment card transactions with the following exception:\n\n
        1.3	MERCHANT may designate a third party that does not have a direct agreement with BANK as its agent for the direct delivery of data-captured Visa transactions to VisaNet for clearing and settlement. MERCHANT must:\n\n
        (a)	Advise BANK that it will use a third party agent.\n\n
        (b)	Agree that BANK must reimburse MERCHANT only for the amount of Visa transactions delivered by BANK to VisaNet, less the appropriate discount fee.\n\n
        (c) Assume responsibility for any failure by its agent to comply with the Visa International Operating Regulations, including but not limited to, any violation resulting in a chargeback.\n\n
        1.4 MERCHANT acknowledges that BANK may provide financial transaction processing hereunder through contracts or subcontracts with third parties engaged in the business of transaction processing and authorization.\n\n
        1.5 BANK hereby notifies MERCHANT that the following options are available hereunder:\n\n
        (i) MERCHANT may elect to accept ONLY consumer credit and commercial cards;\n\n
        (ii) MERCHANT may elect to accept ONLY consumer debit cards; OR\n\n
        (iii) MERCHANT may elect to accept consumer credit and commercial cards and consumer debit cards.\n\n
        <b>2.0 Rights, Duties, and Responsibilities of Merchant:</b>\n\n
        2.1 MERCHANT shall honor all cards provided:\n\n
        (a)	The card is valid and is presented to MERCHANT at the time of the sale by the authorized cardholder or an authorized user of the card account. A card is valid only if it is presented on or after the valid date, if any, and before the expiration date shown on its face.\n\n
        (b)	The card is used as payment for products which are sold or rendered by MERCHANT under this Agreement.\n\n
        (c)	The MERCHANT has followed procedures as established by BANK for completion of sales drafts.\n\n
        2.2 MERCHANT agrees to complete sales drafts in conformity with the terms of this Agreement, American Express Rules and Regulations, the Visa and MasterCard’s ("Card Association”) Rules and Regulations, Discover® Network Operating Regulations, and additionally must comply with the following:\n
        (a)	For transactions that are not mail, phone orders or internet orders, unless electronically swiped, the imprint of the card, including the name of the cardholder, the cardholder account number and the card’s expiration date;\n
        (b)	MERCHANT is not authorized to accept mail or phone order transactions unless specifically authorized by BANK and that acceptance of such transactions without written authorization from BANK will constitute a breach of the Agreement. If MERCHANT is authorized to accept mail or phone order transactions, the name of the cardholder, the cardholder account number and the expiration date;\n
        (c)	The signature of the cardholder or authorized card user. In the case of mail or phone orders, the letters MO or TO, as the case may be, shall be clearly indicated on the sales draft;\n
        (d)	The date of the sale;\n
        (e)	A short description of the products sold or rendered;\n
        (f)	The total cash price of the sale or the words “deposit” or “balance” if full payment is to be made in this manner at different times on different sales drafts; and\n
        (g)	The city and state wherein such transaction occurred.\n
        (h)	Type of fuel sold and odometer reading (if permitted by POS device) in the case of fleet card transactions\n
        (i)	MERCHANT shall deliver a completed copy of the sales draft to the cardholder.\n
        2.3 MERCHANT’S policy for the exchange or return of goods sold and the adjustment for services rendered shall be (i) established and posted in accordance with operating regulations of the applicable Card Associations’, or American Express’ Rules and Regulations, and/or Discover Network Operating Regulations; (ii) such refund policy shall not treat any payment card more favorably than any other payment card; and (iii). MERCHANT agrees to disclose, if applicable, to a cardholder before a card sale is made, that if merchandise is returned:\n\n
        (a)	No refund, or less than full refund, will be given;\n
        (b)	Returned merchandise will only be exchanged for similar merchandise of comparable value;\n
        (c)	Only a credit toward purchases will be given; or\n
        (d)	Special conditions or circumstances apply to the sale (e.g. late delivery, delivery charges, or other noncredit terms).\n
        If MERCHANT does not make these disclosures, a full refund in the form of a credit to the cardholder’s card account must be given. MERCHANT shall under no circumstances issue cash for returns of products where products were originally purchased in a card transaction. Disclosures must be made on all copies of sales drafts or invoices in letters approximately 1/4 inch high in close proximity to the space provided for the cardholder’s signature or on an invoice issued at the time of the sale or on an invoice being presented for the cardholder’s signature. BANK will not reimburse the MERCHANT for interchange, dues, fees and assessments on returns and refunds. BANK will bill MERCHANT on gross processing volume.\n\n
        2.4 MERCHANT may not process for payment any transaction(s) representing the refinancing of an existing obligation of a cardholder including, but not limited to, obligations (i) previously owed to MERCHANT, (ii) arising from the dishonor of a cardholder’s personal check, and/or (iii) representing the collection of any other pre-existing indebtedness.\n\n
        2.5 MERCHANT must not disclose a cardholder account number, personal information, or other transaction information to third parties other than to MERCHANT’S agent, BANK, or BANK’S agent for the sole purpose of assisting MERCHANT in completing the transaction or as required by law. MERCHANT must store all material containing cardholder account numbers or imprints in an area limited to selected personnel and render all data unreadable prior to discarding. MERCHANT must not retain or store magnetic-stripe data verification data subsequent to authorization of a transaction.\n\n
        2.6 MERCHANT agrees it will not require, unless specifically allowed by law, any cardholder to pay any part of any discount or charge imposed upon MERCHANT by this Agreement, whether through any increase in price or otherwise. Further, unless specifically allowed by law MERCHANT will not require a customer presenting a card for payment to pay any charge not also required from a person paying cash. These terms shall not, however, be construed as prohibiting discounts to customers for payments in cash.\n\n
        2.7 MERCHANT agrees to obtain an authorization on all transactions. Any transaction which cannot be authorized electronically through a terminal is subject to a voice authorization charge. MERCHANT will obtain an authorization prior to completing a keyed transaction. Any transaction which is not properly authorized is made with full recourse and may be charged back to MERCHANT; furthermore, any keyed transaction will be subject to additional charges for a non-qualifying transaction. MERCHANT understands that an authorization does not constitute a guarantee of payment, only available credit and may be subject to dispute or chargeback. By signing this Agreement, Merchant agrees that the use of a “store &amp; forward” terminal means that Merchant has the ability to store a swiped transaction at the terminal level when there is no phone line available. When a phone line becomes available, Merchant would then upload the transaction for a possible approval. Merchant understands and agrees that if Merchant uses this type of terminal, there is no guaranty whatsoever that once the transactions are uploaded Merchant will receive an approval. If Merchant allows the release of merchandise/service to the cardholder before receiving approval, Merchant agrees that this is to be done at Merchant’s sole risk.\n\n
        2.8	MERCHANT shall not complete any card sale for which an authorization has been declined. Any unauthorized card transaction is made with full recourse to MERCHANT, and BANK may charge back the amount of such card sale to MERCHANT.\n\n
        2.9	MERCHANT acknowledges that BANK shall have full recourse to charge back the amount of a card sale for which (i) the imprint of the card is not obtained or (ii) the signature of the cardholder is not obtained and the cardholder disputes that he/she authorized the charge.\n\n
        2.10 MERCHANT agrees to electronically deposit sales drafts and credit vouchers no later than the business day following the transaction date.\n\n
        2.11 (a) MERCHANT shall, at all times, maintain an account at a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve ACH System (“the Account”). All credits for collected funds and debits for fees, payments and chargebacks under the terms of this Agreement shall be made to the Account. MERCHANT may not close or change the Account without written notice to BANK. MERCHANT will be solely liable for all fees and costs associated with the Account and for all overdrafts. MERCHANT will maintain sufficient funds in the Account to accommodate all transactions, including fees, contemplated by this Agreement. (b) MERCHANT shall promptly upon receipt, examine, balance, and reconcile all statements relating to the Account. Additionally, MERCHANT shall daily balance and reconcile all DAILY deposit and debit totals to confirm accuracy. MERCHANT is required to notify BANK IN WRITING of any and all errors on MERCHANT’S statements and/or DAILY totals. Each such written notice shall contain the following information: (i) MERCHANT name and account number, (ii) the specific dollar amount of the asserted error, (iii) a detailed description of the asserted error, and (iv) a detailed explanation of why MERCHANT believes an error exists and the cause of the error, if known. The written notice MUST be RECEIVED by BANK within ninety (90) days after MERCHANT receives the statement (regarding an asserted error on a statement) or within ninety (90) days from the date the alleged error on a DAILY total was made. <b>FAILURE TO TIMELY SEND THE NOTICE REFERRED TO HEREIN CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF ANY AND ALL RIGHTS MERCHANT MAY HAVE AGAINST BANK RELATED TO THE ASSERTED ERROR.</b> (c) MERCHANT agrees to fees of up to $10 per occurrence for maintenance activities including but not limited to Account changes and returned mail.\n\n
        2.12 MERCHANT assumes the responsibility for storage of all sales drafts and credit vouchers. Failure to provide BANK with requested documentation within five (5) business days after receipt of such request may result in the transaction being charged back to MERCHANT, and BANK shall have the right to debit the Account for full amount of the transaction in question.\n\n
        2.13 MERCHANT shall pay any fees charged to MERCHANT by the telephone company for the preparation of the site(s) prior to installation of electronic data capture terminals and/or peripheral equipment.\n\n
        2.14 MERCHANT shall not deposit any transaction for the purpose of obtaining or providing a cash advance. MERCHANT agrees that any such deposit shall be grounds for immediate termination.\n\n
        2.15 MERCHANT must notify BANK in writing of any changes to the information in this Application, including but not limited to:\n\n
        (a)	Transfer or sale of any substantial part of its total assets, or liquidate;\n
        (b)	Change the basic nature of its business, including selling any products or services not related to its current business;\n
        (c)	Change ownership or transfer control of its business; or\n
        (d)	Enter into any joint venture, partnership or similar business arrangement whereby any person or entity not a party to this Agreement assumes any interest in MERCHANT’S business.\n
        The notice must be received by BANK within ten (10) business days of the change. MERCHANT will provide updated information to BANK within a reasonable time upon request. Failure to provide notice as required above may be deemed as material breach and shall be sufficient grounds for immediate termination of MERCHANT. In the event any of the changes listed above should occur, BANK shall have the option to renegotiate the terms of this Agreement or provide thirty (30) days’ notice of termination. MERCHANT is liable to BANK for all losses and expenses incurred by BANK arising out of a failure to report changes to BANK.\n\n
        2.16 MERCHANT is liable for repayment to BANK for all valid chargebacks. BANK will comply with American Express’ Operating Regulations, Card Associations’ prevailing Rules and Regulations, and/or Discover Network Operating Regulations in processing any chargebacks which result from cardholder disputes. However, all disputes which are not or cannot be resolved through established chargeback procedures shall be settled between MERCHANT and the cardholder, and MERCHANT will indemnify BANK and will provide reimbursement for all expenses, including reasonable attorney’s costs, which it may incur as the result of any cardholder claim which is pursued outside the American Express’, or Card Association’s Rules and Regulations, and/or Discover Network Operating Regulations.

These security interest and liens will secure all of MERCHANT’S obligations under this Agreement and any other agreements between MERCHANT and BANK including, but not limited to, MERCHANT’S obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to BANK. With respect to such security interests and liens, BANK will have all rights afforded under the Uniform Commercial Code, any other applicable law and in equity. MERCHANT will obtain from BANK written consent prior to granting a security interest of any kind in the Secured Assets to a third party. In the event MERCHANT grants a security interest in the Secured Assets to a third party with BANK’S consent, MERCHANT agrees that any indebtedness arising from the bona fide sale of goods and/or services are free of liens, claims, and encumbrances other than ordinary sales taxes. Merchant represents and warrants that no other person or entity has a security interest in any property in which you have granted BANK a security interest hereunder. MERCHANT agrees that this is a contract of recoupment and BANK is not required to file a motion for relief from a bankruptcy action automatic stay to realize on any of the Secured Assets. Nevertheless, MERCHANT agrees not to contest or object to any motion for relief from the automatic stay filed by BANK. MERCHANT hereby grants BANK the right to offset by ACH any account MERCHANT has in ANY financial institution in order to collect any amount due from MERCHANT to BANK pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n
        8.7 Reserve Account. (i) Establishment: Upon termination of this Agreement or upon BANK’S request and within BANK’S sole discretion, MERCHANT will establish and maintain a deposit (“Reserve Account”) at BANK in an amount reasonably determined by BANK necessary to protect BANK’S interests under this Agreement. (ii) Funding: BANK has the right to debit the Account to establish or maintain funds in the Reserve Account. BANK may deposit into the Reserve Account funds it would otherwise be obligated to pay MERCHANT, for the purpose of establishing or maintaining the Reserve Account in accordance with this Section, if it determines such action is reasonably necessary to protect its interests. (iii) Funds: in no event will MERCHANT be entitled to return of Reserve Account funds before two-hundred seventy (270) days following the effective date of termination of this Agreement, provided however, that MERCHANT will remain liable to BANK for all liabilities occurring beyond such two-hundred seventy (270) day period. BANK will have sole control of the Reserve Account. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding and the determination by the court that this Agreement is assumable under Bankruptcy Code Section 365, as amended from time to time, MERCHANT must establish or maintain a Reserve Account in an amount satisfactory to BANK.\n\n
        8.8 Recoupment and Set-Off. BANK has the right of recoupment and set-off from the Reserve Account or the Account. This means that it may offset any outstanding/uncollected amounts owed from: (i) any amounts it would otherwise be obligated to deposit into the MERCHANT Account, and (ii) any other amounts MERCHANT may owe BANK under this Agreement or any other agreement. MERCHANT acknowledges that in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, in order for MERCHANT to provide adequate protection under Bankruptcy Code Section 362 to BANK, MERCHANT must create or maintain the Reserve Account as required by BANK, and BANK will have the right of offset against the Reserve Account for any and all obligations which MERCHANT may owe to BANK, without regard to whether the obligations relate to sales drafts initiated or created before or after the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\n\n
        8.9 If MERCHANT is terminated for cause, MERCHANT acknowledges that BANK may be required to report MERCHANT’S business name and the names and other identification of its principals to the Member Alert to Control High-Risk (M.A.T.C.H.) maintained by MasterCard. MERCHANT expressly agrees and consents to such reporting in the event MERCHANT is terminated for any of the reasons specified as cause by VISA, MasterCard, and Discover Network. Furthermore, MERCHANT shall hold harmless BANK for claims which MERCHANT may raise as a result of such reporting.\n\n
        8.10 Bankruptcy. MERCHANT will immediately notify BANK of any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar action or proceeding initiated by or against MERCHANT or any of its principals. MERCHANT will include BANK on the list and matrix of creditors as filed with the Bankruptcy Court, whether or not a claim may exist at the time of filing, and failure to do so will be cause for immediate termination or any other action available to BANK under applicable rules or law. MERCHANT acknowledges that this Agreement constitutes an executory contract to make a loan, or extend other debt financing or financial accommodations to or for the benefit of MERCHANT, and, as such, cannot be assumed or assigned in the event of MERCHANT’S bankruptcy.\n\n
        8.11 In the event BANK and MERCHANT agree to any reduction of a rate or a fee set forth in this Agreement, merchant hereby agrees that said reduction shall result in an extension of the Term of this Agreement by three (3) years from the date said rate or fee reduction takes effect.\n\n

        10.1 Card Plans. This Agreement is subject to the bylaws and rules promulgated by VISA, MasterCard, Discover Network, or any other card plan. The parties hereto are bound by and shall fully comply with these bylaws and rules and by such amendments or additions as may be made hereto. The parties hereto shall further comply with all Debit/ATM Network rules and regulations.\n\n
        10.2 Inspection of Books and Records.

        10.4 Privacy. BBVA Compass Bank complies with the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities. Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account or becomes a new customer of the financial institution. Our Customer Identification Program is designed to comply with all federal mandates. When MERCHANT opens an account or obtains a service from the bank, BANK will ask for owner/officer name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow BANK to identify MERCHANT. BANK will also be asking MERCHANT to provide identifying documentation, such as driver’s license or other forms of identification. BANK can and will refuse to open an account or provide services if adequate identification is not provided, or BANK is dissatisfied with the identification provided. BANK collects non-public personal information about MERCHANT from the following sources: Information received from on applications or other forms; Information about transactions with BANK, our affiliates, or others; and Information received from consumer reporting agencies. As required by the USA PATRIOT Act, BANK also collects information and takes actions necessary to verify MERCHANT identity. BANK may disclose all the information collected, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on BANK’S behalf, to American Express, or to other financial institutions with which BANK has joint marketing agreements. BANK does not disclose any non-public personal information about our MERCHANTS to anyone, including our affiliates, except as permitted by law. Internally, BANK restricts access to non-public personal information about MERCHANTS to associates who need to know that information to provide customer support and or to maintain records. BANK’S internal conduct clearly defines the manner in which an associate may access, use, or disseminate non-public information. BANK maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard MERCHANT’S non-public personal information. If MERCHANT decides to close account(s) or become an inactive merchant, BANK will adhere to the policies and practices as described in this notice.\n\n
        10.4 (i) PRIVACY POLICY. MERCHANT represents, warrants and covenants that it has obtained all required consents from cardholders in respect of their personal information to be accessed, collected, used or transferred by BANK in providing the services under this Agreement, and it has read, understood and hereby accepts Paysafe’s privacy policy on behalf of itself and the Cardholders at https://www.paysafe.com/privacy-policy/.\n\n

        10.6 Amendment. MERCHANT acknowledges that the terms set forth herein including but not limited to fees, rates, and charges may be changed by BANK.

        10.9 Attorney’s Fees and Costs. MERCHANT shall be liable for and indemnify BANK for any and all attorney’s fees and other costs and expenses paid or incurred by the BANK in the enforcement hereof, or in collecting any amounts due from MERCHANT to BANK hereunder or resulting from any breach by MERCHANT of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n
        10.10 Dispute Resolution; Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.

MERCHANT understands membership fee is in addition to fees charged by BANK in MERCHANT’S Merchant Payment Card Agreement. In the event MERCHANT’S Merchant Payment Card Agreement is terminated during the existence of any term of membership, the fee shall be paid for the remainder of the then existing term. Example: In the event a MERCHANT becomes a member and is terminated after seven (7) months, the remaining five (5) months of fees shall still be paid by MERCHANT to BANK. For all members in good standing, and subject to the terms herein, BANK shall provide equipment support or repair during the membership term.

MERCHANT agrees to pay BANK additional fees for Saturday or priority delivery. In the event BANK replaces any item of equipment for MERCHANT’S faulty equipment, MERCHANT is required to send BANK the faulty equipment within thirty (30) days from the date MERCHANT receives the replacement equipment. In the event MERCHANT fails to comply with this Section, MERCHANT shall be required to pay BANK the full retail price for the replacement equipment immediately upon the expiration of said thirty (30) day period. Full membership benefits do not take effect for thirty (30) days following the Date of Enrollment. In the event BANK provides replacement equipment during the first thirty (30) days of membership, MERCHANT shall pay BANK the sum of $75.00 per unit replaced.

However, all disputes which are not or cannot be resolved through established chargeback procedures shall be settled between MERCHANT and the cardholder, and MERCHANT will indemnify BANK and will provide reimbursement for all expenses, including reasonable attorney’s costs, which it may incur as the result of any cardholder claim which is pursued outside the Debit/ATM Network Rules and Regulations.\n\n
        10.16 MERCHANT agrees to $25 per hour, with one (1) hour minimum, research fee to be charged by BANK for research it performs at MERCHANT’S request.\n\n
        10.17 For purposes of compliance with Payment Card Industry Security Standards, MERCHANT is required to notify BANK in writing of any changes to the software type and version number from that originally stated within this Agreement.

        11.1 If MERCHANT executes a Wright Express (“WEX”) Merchant Agreement, MERCHANT understands that BANK will provide such agreement to WEX, but that neither BANK nor WEX shall have any obligation whatsoever to MERCHANT with respect to processing WEX Cards unless and until WEX executes WEX Merchant Agreement. If WEX executes WEX Merchant Agreement and MERCHANT accepts WEX Cards, MERCHANT understands that WEX transactions are processed, authorized, and funded by WEX. MERCHANT understands that WEX is solely responsible for all agreements that govern WEX transactions and that BANK is not responsible and assumes absolutely no liability with regard to any such agreement or WEX transactions, including, but not limited to, the funding and settlement of WEX transactions. MERCHANT understands that WEX will charge additional fees for the services that it provides.\n\n

MERCHANT acknowledges that it is the MERCHANT’s sole obligation to ensure that it possesses the most current version of the American Express Operating Regulations and the American Express OptBlue Program Merchant Requirements as they are amended from time to time.</b>\n\n
        13.3 <b>Prohibited Goods and Services.</b> MERCHANT must accept the Card as payment for goods and services sold (other than those goods and services prohibited under the subsection below), or (if applicable) for charitable contributions made, at all of its Establishments, except as expressly permitted by state statute. MERCHANT is jointly and severally liable for the obligations of MERCHANT’S Establishments under the Agreement. MERCHANT must not accept the Card to verify a cardholder’s age or for any of the following:\n\n
        (i)	adult digital content sold via Internet Electronic Delivery;\n\n
        (ii) amounts that do not represent bona fide sales of goods or services (or, if applicable, amounts that do not represent bona fide charitable contributions made) at MERCHANT’S Establishments; for example, purchases at MERCHANT’S Establishments by MERCHANT’S owners (or their family members) or employees contrived for cash flow purposes, or payments that MERCHANT have accepted in order to advance cash to cardholders in connection with the transaction;\n\n
        (iii) amounts that do not represent bona fide, direct sales by MERCHANT’S Establishment to Card Members made in the ordinary course of MERCHANT’S business;\n\n
        (iv) cash or cash equivalent (e.g., gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and/or bars), but collectible coins and jewelry are not prohibited;\n\n
        (v) charges that the cardholder has not specifically approved;\n\n

        13.4 <b>High Volume.</b> MERCHANT agrees that in the event its annual charge volume for American Express Cards is greater than $1,000,000, then American Express may initiate the process of converting MERCHANT to an AXP Direct Merchant. Upon conversion MERCHANT shall be bound by American Express’ then-current Card Acceptance agreement and American Express will set pricing and other fees payable by the MERCHANT for American Express card acceptance.\n\n
        13.5 <b>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (as to Claims involving American Express).</b> In the event that MERCHANT or Participant is not able to resolve a Claim against American Express, or a claim against Participant or any other entity that American Express has a right to join, this section explains how Claims may be resolved through arbitration. Merchant or American Express may elect to resolve any Claim by binding individual arbitration. Claims will be decided by a neutral arbitrator. If arbitration is elected by any party, MERCHANT nor Participant nor American Express will have the right to litigate or have a jury trial on that Claim in court. Further, MERCHANT, Participant, and American Express will not have the right to participate in a class action or in a representative capacity or in a group of persons alleged to be similarly situated pertaining to any Claim subject to arbitration under this Agreement. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules in court. An arbitrator’s decisions are final and binding, and the arbitrator’s final decision on a Claim generally is enforceable as a court order with very limited review by a court. Other rights MERCHANT, Participant, or American Express would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.\n\n
        (i)	Initiation of Arbitration. Claims may be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement and the selected organization’s rules in effect when the Claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Agreement. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims may be referred to another arbitration organization if all parties agree in writing, if American Express selects the organization and MERCHANT selects the other within 30 days thereafter or if an arbitrator is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (FAA). Any arbitration hearing will take place in the federal judicial district where MERCHANT’S headquarters is located or New York, NY, at MERCHANT’S election.\n\n
        (ii) Limitations on Arbitration. <b>If any party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. No Claim is to be arbitrated on a class or purported representative basis or on behalf of the general public or other persons allegedly similarly situated.</b> The arbitrator’s authority is limited to Claims between MERCHANT, Participant, and American Express. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case brought by MERCHANT, Participant or American Express and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award as between MERCHANT, Participant and American Express. This prohibition is intended to, and does, preclude MERCHANT from participating in any action by any trade association or other organization against American Express. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration is found invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration Agreement (other than this sentence) will not apply, except that MERCHANT, Participant, and American Express do not waive the right to appeal that decision.\n\n
        (iii) Previously Filed Claims/No Waiver. MERCHANT, Participant, or American Express may elect to arbitrate any Claim that has been filed in court at any time before trial has begun or final judgment has been entered on the Claim. MERCHANT, Participant, or American Express may choose to delay enforcing or to not exercise rights under this Arbitration Agreement, including the right to elect to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights on any other occasion. For the avoidance of any confusion, and not to limit its scope, this section applies to any class-action lawsuit relating to the “Honor All Cards,” “non-discrimination,” or “no steering” provisions of the American Express Merchant Regulations, or any similar provisions of any prior American Express Card acceptance agreement, that was filed against American Express prior to the Effective Date of the Agreement to the extent that such claims are not already subject to arbitration pursuant to a prior agreement between MERCHANT and American Express.\n\n
        (iv) Arbitrator’s Authority. The arbitrator will have the power and authority to award any relief that would have been available in court and that is authorized under this Agreement. The arbitrator has no power or authority to alter the Agreement or any of its separate provisions, including this arbitration agreement.\n\n
        (v) Split Proceedings for Equitable Relief. MERCHANT, Participant, or American Express may seek equitable relief in aid of arbitration prior to arbitration on the merits if necessary to preserve the status quo pending completion of the arbitration. This section shall be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement is entitled to seek an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.\n\n
        (vi) Small Claims. American Express will not elect arbitration for any Claim MERCHANT properly files in a small claims court so long as the Claim seeks individual relief only and is pending only in that court.\n\n
        (vii) Governing Law/Arbitration Procedures/Entry of Judgment. This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator shall apply New York law and applicable statutes of limitations and honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall apply the rules of the arbitration organization selected, as applicable to matters relating to evidence and discovery, not federal or any state rules of procedure or evidence, provided that any party may ask the arbitrator to expand discovery by making a written request, to which the other parties will have 15 days to respond before the arbitrator rules on the request. If MERCHANT’S Claim is for $10,000 or less, MERCHANT may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the rules of the selected arbitration organization. At the timely request of a party, the arbitrator will provide a written opinion explaining his/her award. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any rights of appeal provided by the FAA. Judgment on an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any state or federal court in the federal judicial district where MERCHANT’S headquarters or MERCHANT’S assets are located.\n\n
        (viii) Confidentiality. The arbitration proceeding and all information submitted, relating to or presented in connection with or during the proceeding, shall be deemed confidential information not to be disclosed to any person not a party to the arbitration. All communications, whether written or oral, made in the course of or in connection with the Claim and its resolution, by or on behalf of any party or by the arbitrator or a mediator, including any arbitration award or judgment related thereto, are confidential and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment or estoppel, in any other litigation or proceeding; provided, however, that evidence shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable solely as a result of its use in the arbitration.\n\n
        (ix) Costs of Arbitration Proceedings. Merchant will be responsible for paying MERCHANT’S share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees MERCHANT would have incurred if MERCHANT had brought a claim in court. American Express will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.

MERCHANT must not use the American Express Marks in any way that injures or diminishes the goodwill associated with the Mark, nor (without prior written consent from Participant) indicate that American Express endorse MERCHANT’S goods or services. MERCHANT shall only use the American Express Marks as permitted by the Agreement and shall cease using our Marks upon termination of the Agreement. For additional guidelines on the use of the American Express Marks, contact Merchant’s payment processing company.\n\n
        <b>13.8 Treatment of American Express Card Member Information.</b> Any and all Card Member Information is confidential and the sole property of the Issuer, American Express or its Affiliates.
